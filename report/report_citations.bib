abstract = {Digital control of color television monitors—in particular, via frame buffers—has added precise control of a large subset of human colorspace to the capabilities of computer graphics. This subset is the gamut of colors spanned by the red, green, and blue (RGB) electron guns exciting their respective phosphors. It is called the RGB monitor gamut. Full-blown color theory is a quite complex subject involving physics, psychology, and physiology, but restriction to the RGB monitor gamut simplifies matters substantially. It is linear, for example, and admits to familiar spatial representations. This paper presents a set of alternative models of the RGB monitor gamut based on the perceptual variables hue (H), saturation (S), and value (V) or brightness (L). Algorithms for transforming between these models are derived. Particular emphasis is placed on an RGB to HSV non-trigonometric pair of transforms which have been used successfully for about four years in frame buffer painting programs. These are fast, accurate, and adequate in many applications. Computationally more difficult transform pairs are sometimes necessary, however. Guidelines for choosing among the models are provided. Psychophysical corrections are described within the context of the definitions established by the NTSC (National Television Standards Committee).},

	abstract = {Emerging battery applications, including hybrid electric vehicles, are challenging existing lead--acid battery designs with demands for improved partial-state-of-charge (PSoC) operation. Unlike conventional deep-cycle operation, the battery is infrequently, or never, returned to full charge. Performance is therefore limited by the extent of lead sulfate that accumulates on the negative plate. There are a number of proposed solutions under investigation that are aimed at delaying or reducing the sulfation of the negative plate. Improved grid designs and the introduction of carbon and other additives into the negative plate have been shown to improve battery performance in PSoC operation. The details of these improvements must be better understood if lead--acid batteries are to succeed in PSoC applications.},

To achieve optimal utilization and protection of batteries, battery management is used. This battery management system prevents batteries from overdischarge and overcharge and provides cell balancing. Accurate state of charge estimation is necessary for these tasks. There are several methods for state of charge determination which can be divided as direct measurement methods, book-keeping methods, adaptive methods and hybrid methods. In this article, commonly used state of charge estimation methods, advantages and disadvantages are described.},

The charging and discharging characteristics are investigated and reveal that the coulomb counting method is convenient and accurate for estimating the SOC of lithium-ion batteries. A smart estimation method based on coulomb counting is proposed to improve the estimation accuracy. The corrections are made by considering the charging and operating efficiencies. Furthermore, the state-of-health (SOH) is evaluated by the maximum releasable capacity. Through the experiments that emulate practical operations, the SOC estimation method is verified to demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy.},

	abstract = {Summary Estimating the dynamic status parameters of a battery, such as its state of health (SoH) and remaining useful life (RUL), is still a very difficult and complex task. In this paper we perform a structured review of the most relevant state of the art models, algorithms and commercial devices employed in the estimation of the SoH/RUL battery performance figures, in the context of embedded applications. The models and estimation techniques are thoroughly classified and, for each taxonomy class, a presentation of the working principles is made. A comprehensive set of metrics is then introduced for the evaluation of the SoH/RUL estimation techniques from the perspective of their implementation and operation efficiency in embedded systems. These algorithms are then analyzed and discussed in a comparative manner, with concrete figures and results. The capability and the performance of the different types of off-the-shelf fuel gauges to estimate the battery SoH/RUL parameters are also evaluated in this paper.
