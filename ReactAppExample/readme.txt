Read through server.js to see a bit of node.js syntax 
then go to /src and take a look at the js files for the front end

For mysql I would suggest thinking of what you want to use it for and then just go here:
https://www.mysqltutorial.org/

It will most probably have a detailed tutorial of what you might want to do. It also has docs on how to install it and stuff but I do not know about configuring it with Azure.

For the libraries for nodejs you need to have npm installed and for the react libraries you need yarn.

Ended up deleting the modules from the node_modules folder to free up space
